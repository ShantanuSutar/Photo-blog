PHOTO BLOG

This is nothing a but a simple looking photo-blog which has photos of Denmark(which I really want to go to someday)

And I got all the images of mine from "unsplash.com" website, if you want free to use images, you can check it out

Challenging part here was that all the photos were of different resolutions and I wanted them to look similar

So, I used 'object fit' property in CSS to solve it

And now it looks greattt...
